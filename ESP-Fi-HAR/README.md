# ESP-Fi HAR: A Low-Power WiFi CSI Dataset for Ad-Hoc IoT Human Activity Recognition
## Introduction
ESP-Fi HAR is a publicly available WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) dataset collected using low-power, commodity ESP32 modules. It targets privacy-preserving, energy-efficient Human Activity Recognition (HAR) in resource-constrained ad-hoc IoT networks.

Unlike traditional CSI datasets that rely on high-power Intel 5300 or Atheros network cards, ESP-Fi HAR demonstrates the feasibility of scalable HAR using inexpensive IoT hardware. The dataset covers four indoor environments (Corridor, Office, Meeting Room, Laboratory) and seven daily activities.

We provide a PyTorch benchmark suite including 7 deep learning models, covering convolutional networks (CNN, ResNet variants), recurrent architectures (LSTM/GRU), and Transformer-based models, optimized for the ESP-Fi CSI format (1×950×52 amplitude).

## Requirements

1. Install `pytorch` and `torchvision` (we use `pytorch==1.12.0` and `torchvision==0.13.0`).
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Supervised Learning
To run models with supervised learning (train & test):  
Run: `python run.py --model [model name] `  

python run.py --model CNN

## Supported Models
- CNN
- ResNet18
- GRU
- LSTM
- Transformer
- MobileNetV3
- EfficientNetLite

Results (accuracy, loss, best model .pth, CSV logs) are saved in ./training_logs/.


## Training Settings

- Train/test split
- Input: CSI amplitude only
- Normalization: Z-score per sample
- Optimizer: AdamW
- Scheduler: CosineAnnealingLR
- Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Macro-F1

Note: Best model is selected based on training accuracy (no validation split available). Test set is used only for final evaluation.

- Logs and checkpoints are saved in ./training_logs/

- Training CSV includes per-epoch:
TrainAcc, TrainLoss, TestAcc, TestF1, TestLoss

- Final Test CSV includes best model performance.

## Batch Size Recommendation (8GB GPU)

| Model Type | Batch Size |
|------------|-----------|
| GRU | 64 |
| CNN /LSTM / ResNet18 / MobileNetV3 /EfficientNetLite | 32 |
| Transformer | 4 |

## Measure CPU inference latency

Latency is measured on CPU only to reflect realistic IoT deployment conditions.

With trained checkpoint:

Run: ` python latency-cpu.py --checkpoint training_logs/best_CNN.pth `

If you want to measure latency for another model, replace best_CNN.pth with the corresponding checkpoint.

## Dataset
### ESP-Fi HAR
 
- **CSI size** : 1 x 950 x 52
- **number of classes** : 7
- **classes** : run, fall, walk, turn, jump, squat, arm wave
- **Indoor scenarios & samples per scene** :
  - Corridor: 560 samples (train/test split included)
  - Office: 560 samples
  - Meeting Room: 560 samples
  - Laboratory: 560 samples

#### Dataset Organization

The ESP-Fi HAR dataset is hierarchically organized across three dimensions: **scenario**, **participant**, and **activity**.  

Each sample follows the structured naming convention: **X-Y-Z-M**, where:

- **X**: Scenario ID (1–4), corresponding to four indoor scenarios:
  1. Corridor
  2. Office
  3. Meeting Room
  4. Laboratory
- **Y**: Participant ID (1–8)
- **Z**: Activity ID (1–7), mapped to predefined actions:
  - 1: run
  - 2: fall
  - 3: walk
  - 4: turn
  - 5: jump
  - 6: squat
  - 7: arm wave
- **M**: Trial number (1–10), indexing repeated trials per participant per scenario

> Example: `2-5-3-7.mat` → Scenario 2 (Office), Participant 5, Activity 3 (walk), Trial 7
